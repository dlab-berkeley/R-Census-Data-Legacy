# Getting Started

## Setup

Welcome! While we're waiting:

* Navigate to the workshop webpage: <https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Census-Data-in-R>

    - Make a note of the folder in which the workshop files reside. 
    

## Introduction

- About me

- About you
    - Your familiarity with US Census data
    - With geospatial data
    - With geospatial data in R

## Outline

- **Brief** overview of the primary US Census data products

- Introduce R packages for working with census data

- Use those packages to fetch census data

# Census Data Overview

## US Census Data

The "nation's leading provider of quality data about its people and economy."

<img src="data/census_page.png" width="700px"></img>

Available at <https://www.census.gov>

## Primary Census Products

- Decennial Census

- American Community Survey (ACS)

## Decennial Census

Complete count of the population every 10 years since `1790` 

A snapshot of the American population in time.

Includes data on 

- Population, by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and family / household relationships

- Housing, by occupancy (occupied, vacant), tenure (owned, rented), and group quarters

From 1840 to 2000, additional questions were asked of a `sample` of the population.

- See [https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/)



## American Community Survey (ACS)

Since 2005, the `American Community Survey (ACS)` has replaced the decennial census sample data questions.

- Annual survey of a sample of about 3.5 million households conducted over a 1, 3 or 5 year period.

- Provides `estimates` of demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics

- Includes `margin of error` values for the estimates

 
## Decennial Census* versus ACS Data
| Demographic*    | Social             | Economic          | Housing           |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Sex             | Families           | Income            | Tenure*           |
| Age             | Education          | Benefits          | Occupancy*        |
| Race            | Marital Status     | Employment Status | Group quarters*   |
| Hispanic Origin | Fertility          | Occupation        | Housing Value     |
| Relationships   | Grandparents       | Industry          | Taxes & Insurance |
|                 | Veterans           | Commuting         | Utilities         |
|                 | Disability Status  | Place of Work     | Mortgage          |
|                 | Language at Home   | Health Insurance  | Monthly Rent      |
|                 | Citizenship        |                   | Structure Type    |
|                 | Mobility           |                   |                   |


## Census Geographies

Census microdata (data collected from individuals) are publicly available at one or more levels of geographic aggregation, or `tabulation unit`. 

- Tabulation units include states, counties, census tracts, block groups, blocks, etc.

Not all data tables are available all geographies, e.g., only decennial census data are available at the block level.

## ACS Data Products

ACS 1-year and 5-year products are currently available through 2019

- New data is released at the end of the next year (e.g., 2020 data in Dec 2021)
- But COVID is causing a [delay in the release dates](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/news/data-releases/2020/release-schedule.html) 

ACS 3-year no longer available (2008—2013)

ACS 5-year data provides much better estimates, lower margins of error

- More data tables are available for ACS 5-year product

See: [Census ACS: Guidance for Data Users](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance.html)


## Census Data Workflow

Identify your 

- Topic of interest, e.g., population by age, income, monthly rents, etc...
- Dataset: Decennial Census or ACS?
- Year(s): for what time period?
- Geographic tabulation unit of aggregation (county, tract, etc.)
- Geographic filter by state(s) or counties

Then determine what specific census variables are available for your topic.

## CAUTION

"If you want to measure change you can't change the measures!"

**Census tables, variables, geographies, and geographic boundaries change over time!**

Measuring change over time with census data is *its own thing*, complex, and not covered by this workshop!

## Accessing Census Data

Here are three of the primary websites from which you can directly access and download census data:

- [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci) or 
- [NHGIS.org](https://www.nhgis.org/)
- [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/), a subscription service but FREE for UCB community

You can download Census `geographic data` directly on the [census website](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files.2019.html) or from NHGIS.

## Census APIs

You can write code to fetch data from the [Census Web APIs](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html)

- `API`: application programming interface

- `Web API`: URLs can be formatted to make queries that return data

Or you can leverage an existing R package to make this easier!

- That's what we will do!

*Only a subset of recent Census data products are available via APIs.*

# R Packages for Working with Census Data

## R Packages for Working with Census Data

These are the ones we recommend and will use today.

- [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)

- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
   
- [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)

- [mapview](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/)


## [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)

An R package with functions that make it easier to fetch decennial census and ACS data from the Census APIs.

Only a limited set of Census data available via `tidycensus`

- Decennial census: 1990, 2000, and 2010
  
- ACS 1 yr: 2005 through 2019
  
- ACS 5 yr: 2005—2009 through 2015—2019 are available. 
    
Actively maintained and expanding to include more census data products (see `tidycensus` website)

    
## About [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)

Developed by [Kyle Walker](https://walkerke.github.io/) to make it easier to fetch data from Census APIs in **R** in a `tidy` format to analyze, plot, and map.

Check out his website to keep abreast of his great packages, blog posts, and tutorials.

- https://walker-data.com/

And his new ebook [Analyzing the US Census with R](https://walker-data.com/census-r/), currently available to read online.

Walker also develped a new [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) course: [Analyzing US Census Data in R!](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-r)

- Highly recommended! First chapter free!

## [tidycensus tutorials](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html)

## [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)

The **tidyverse** package is an umbrella package that installs all the core tidyverse packages and makes them easier to manage and load in R, including:

- `ggplot2`, for data visualization
- `dplyr`, for data manipulation
- `tidyr`, for data tidying
- `readr`, for data import
- `purrr`, for functional programming
- `tibble`, for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames
- `stringr`, for strings
- `forcats`, for factors

*Learn more about the `tidyverse` at <https://www.tidyverse.org>.*


## [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package

`Simple features` for geospatial data objects and methods.

- The main R package for working with vector geospatial data
    - `vector`: locations represented as points, lines and polygons
    
`sf` is loaded and used automatically by `tidycensus`.

The online book [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) is a great resource for learning about the `sf` package and working with geospatial data in R.

## [mapview](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/)

`mapview` provides functions for quickly and easily create interactive mapping visualizations for data exploration.

## Requesting a Census API key

Before you can fetch data from the Census APIs, you must request a free `Census API Key`

Get one now if you don't have one yet!

 - (https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)
